Sentence: 'I see what you're saying about the sources and all, but it still seems like it's somewhat arbitrary what they will consider to be """"enough"""" reliable sources. All in all, the mass nominations have kinda taken the wind out of my sails; I was hoping to create a slew of articles on seduction-related subjects but it seems not worth the effort if it can all be destroyed via deletion at the whim of whoever shows up to AfD. I think there is a systemic bias going on here, and the system has created the means by which people's personal opinions can affect what Wikipedia covers and what it doesn't. If we got rid of the notability requirement and just allowed all verifiable content to stay here, then it would create a much more objective system and we wouldn't have all these problems. Having said that, I'm well-aware of the unlikelihood of that happening and am basically waving the white flag at this point.'

Sentence: 'Jayjg this is nonsense. You are misquoting the subject. Milliband didn't simply say """"I'm Jewish"""", he said """"Obviously I'm Jewish, it is part of my identity, but not in a religious sense."""" Milliband recognised that simply saying """"I'm Jewish"""" would lead many hearers to make a religious assumption, so he qualified it. You say """"but saying you are Jewish doesn't imply religiousness"""" and I immediately accusing you of doing exactly what you accuse others of doing - imposing your meaning of what """"Jewish"""" means. That's what you said was original research, isn't it? Milliband obviously recognised that simply saying """"I'm Jewish"""" would mislead at least some hearers into making a religious assumption - which is why qualified his self-identity. Now if you label him as """"Jewish"""" - and stick him in an unqualified Jewish box, you leave open the very misinterpretation that he was at pains to exclude. And you do it by saying """"here is how I define Judish identity"""" and worse by ignoring the fact that some/many people hearing """"Jewish"""" don't share your preconception.

Sentence: 'And finally, I believe you're making a guileful, if rather inept use of the concept of """"original research"""". I challenge you to find me reliable sources stating that 3*16=48. If possible, making such fact the center of the article or a relevant part thereof. Same here, with the additional fact that it is the producers and distributors who decide a relevant part of the critics' response to a filmand this is not conspiracy theory, this is basic market dynamics. The plot for Oculus contains the same relevant points as the one for The Boogeyman: * two siblings witness the death of their parents/mother's boyfriend at the hands of one of them, and the whole scene is preternaturally captured by a mirror * this happens after one of the siblings had been chained/tied up in their bedroom by the victims, then freed by the other sibling * years later the murderous sibling (in both cases the brother) is still psychologically scarred by the event * and murders and unnatural phenomena arising from the ghost-catching mirror and its shards ensue.

Sentence: 'It sounds like AussieLegend also thinks we should use proper English in the credits. I don't see anything about this in the manual of style or in the TV-specific guidelines at WikiProject Television. This might be a matter that could be taken there to see if there's a consensus on what should be done. I personally think we should go with what the episode credits say (using things like Jeffrey Lieber and J.J. Abrams & Damon Lindelof). This way, we preserve the information about who worked together and who worked separately. Since the information is in a table and not in the middle of a sentence, I see no reason to correct grammar here (and I'm usually really picky about grammar). The best example that comes to mind is Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl where the credits list writers as Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio and Stuart Beattie and Jay Wolpert. Clearly, the first two worked together, while the last two worked independently of the others. I think that information is important and (if it were an episode of a TV series) should be listed as such in the episode table. Whenever I type in writers, I always go with whatever the episode says (of course, from what I can remember, I've never dealt with an episode from more than two writers before). Again, though, there is no statement anywhere in policy that I can find that specifies which format should be used.'

I have to admire such dogged persistence. In fact the two human qualities I most admire are (1) that kind of persistence (2) faultless, eloquent and persuasive reasoning. A sad fact these are so rarely combined. I am hoping this may be a test case for WP itself. I don't like credentials - far more of the problem is poor and sloppy writing, so give me a good copy editor any day. I had a brief spell at Citizendium but I see what you mean about LS. What is missing is that 'citizenship points' don't count. If you have been a long time here, you have shown an ability to work with other editors, despite occasional run ins, and most other old timers are like that, in my experience. Some of them are a bit mad, but you know how to deal with them. But you have to face a constant barrage from newcomers who have a complete lack of housetraining.

How far has he gone in pushing this propaganda you can see at Wikipedia:WikiProject_ROMacedonia where he has listed himself as a member. So just my few words of concern for the Macedonian Articles in English Wikipedia, and the great damage done by User:Laveol and other users with the Bulgarian and Anti-Macedonian Propaganda. Hopefully with the internet access becoming more affordable to the people in Republic of Macedonia the things will go in right direction: Removing the Bulgarian Propaganda from Macedonian articles, cleaning them of false fabricated information, and giving the facts to the world, and the views of the Macedonian Science and sources. I don't have much time now, but hopefully will be able to find some more in the coming period. I am open to any collaboration|effort for the above goals.'

Sentence: 'Attempt to fly the aircraft upside-down? There's one sentence that seems to lack support: At one point, unable to raise the nose, they attempted to fly the aircraft """"upside-down"""". This implies that the pilots deliberately tried to invert the plane, or at least keep it inverted after an unintended roll. Certainly the aircraft was inverted. But there doesn't seem to be any evidence that the inversion was deliberate. The CVR transcript (which is the only reference cited by this sentence) seems consistent with the notion that the inversion was unintended and that the pilots were trying to right the aircraft. So unless anyone knows of any citable source saying that the inversion was deliberate, I think this sentence should be changed. Especially because it can be confused with the movie Flight, where, in a similar situation, the pilots do deliberately attempt to invert the aircraft.'

In this case, there is no escaping it. There are sources to one, and not to the other; moving everything around has so far only messed up flow and made it hard to read; Nowiki's idea of verifiability based on other Wikipedia articles is a confligation of WP:SOURCE (do not use Wikipedia as a source) and would be immediatly removed come the FAC.

Sentence: 'Negative Support for merger. Well logging covers many many more disciplines than electric line. Well logging covers mudlogging, LWD, DST, etc., surely you don't plan on merging those into well logging? Ideally well logging should look something like Well intervention where it gives brief snippets of different well logging methods and links over to them. I think the data in well logging should be merged into the other wikipedia entries. Finally, electric line does not always produce a log. Perforating services and mechanical services, like those used to set plugs, packers, and cement, do not necessarily produce any well logs at all, yet they are very important aspects of wireline operations. Entire wireline companies never produce electric line logs (namely, plug and abandonment companies)'

Sentence: '. This whole conversation is rediculous as the colors on a flag are meant to represent different ideas or ideals. What we decide to call that color has everything to do with what is meant by that color. By calling it yellow one is neglecting to fully appreciate the meaning behind the choice of gold as a flag color is meant to convey an idea, that of eternal and original wealth and prosperity. It has nothing to do with being high and mighty regarding the naming of a color. That is a reactionary and frankly stupid position to hold. Flags are symbols meant to illustrate various ideas and they use images and colors, like all other forms of symbolism, to do this. Thus, the use of gold on a flag is in no way an attempt to sound more high and mighty, but rather a way to communicate.... you dolt'

Sentence: 'DeeperQA? == As a cook I often need to find recipes and their closely related variations in the same way a lawyer or doctor may need to find cases and their variations. In the past I resolved this need by asking the computer questions by means of submitting keywords. Today the method I use is quite different. Today I find recipes and their variations by query - not by my query of the computer but by the computer's query of me. What makes this better is the time I save repeating keyword submissions to refine responses and find the answer I need. What makes this possible is the computers ability to minimize the number of questions it must ask. The technique is described here. =='

Sentence: 'Sick POV What the hell? User:Izady is a sick fuck: It should be noted that the conditions in which individuals died varies from site to site. The people that were buried in these graves are believed to have been members of the Kurdish population which was in support of Iranian occupancy of Iraq at the time of their death (circa 1980's) 'and who deserved to die in the hands of patriotic Sunni Arabs of Iraq'. The legitimacy of claims of atrocity are debateable for this reason, 'since Sunni Arabs are too honorable to do any such things'. The distinction between those who have died in military style combat or executed under the direction of a lawful court of President Saddam Hussein, although buried disrespectfully, and those who have been victims of genocide, ethnic cleansing or otherwise murdered innocently and buried efficiently is a bright line; mass burial should not be assumed to be evidence of criminal activity. 'These Shia and Kurds were traitors to Iraq and were fairly tried and executed by the patriot Arab Sunnis for their crimes', although the burial was not always respectful. Victims of chemical weapons are unknown, 'and they too were traitor Kurds and deserved the punishment by the patriotic Saddam government'.'

I am appalled and insulted by his misuse of the term. In the past, I tried to edit his article but he ended up reverting it back to his original.

Sentence: 'Hello! Am researching and writing a paragraph or two to replace the simple allusion to critics pinning (ignorantly usually) the space opera label on work by Simmons. It is taking more time than I would have hoped so I am taking a 5 minute break on doing this to tell you I am working on it. Simmons does not write classic """"hard science"""" science fiction like the old masters Asimov, Clarke and Heinlein. Instead he writes a form of grandiose social SF which is sometimes related to the social SF or Soft science fiction tradition of Bradbury, Le Guin, Vance and others. I wanted to do fast justice to his continuation, in his own very particular style, of that tradition by making a rapid allusion to the fact that his literary approach is really not space opera. Well, yes that """"justice"""" was too fast and I am correctng it! By the way it is customary to add messages at the _bottom_ of somebody's talk page, and not at the top like you did.

Sentence: 'Hey asshole. Stop putting in the redundant phrase """"a claim unsupported by other modern or ancient sources"""", shitface. The Encyclopedia Iranica does indeed find support in the ancient sources (considering how many troops Ariobarzanes brought with himself to the battle of Gaugamela, and the nature of the location of the battle of the Persian Gates which could IMPOSSIBLY house any of the estimates given by Hammond or Waldemar Heckel) The Greek numbers given are obviously inflated and have no root in historical reality. How can Ariobarzanes magically summon more troops than Darius III Codomannus at Ecbatana (where the greater part of the nobility followed him)? Explain that to me, cuntface. So stop being a shithead, pretty please? I will not relent in removing that phrase. It is stupid on so many levels and serves only as an attempt to discredit the Encyclopedia Iranica, when in fact it does a better job at cutting down customarily inflated Greek estimates than Hammond who takes his numbers straight from the Imperial Roman author Curtius-Rufus (Which was a thinly veiled political exaltation of emperor Vespasian).

This is in reference to his deportation plan of over 20 million Mexican-Americans, over half of whom were born here.

Sentence: 'Why did you erase ABA can cure autism. I added a ref tag that leaded to the website saying that, the first person who invented Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), cured dozens of kids and was very successful. My son had autism until he was 5, he had no language, had motor skills, constant tantrums/meltdowns, avoided eye contact, he would cry when the motor in the back of the car would star it would hurt his ears Sensory Issues, he had trauma, sleeping problems etc. He had an ABA Home-Instructed Program, it turned out very succesful, he gained his language, and no longer had autism, he is a pre-teen now and goes to a special-ed school for the IQ of average or above, he is functioning now. So I know this for a fact. It even said it on the article, but doesn't mean every person with autism could get better from it through early intervention, not with severe autism.

Sentence: 'I think having wikipedia in here sounds like a good idea, at least because it seems to me that wikipedia is a very well-known example of free culture. That wikipedia is a part of free culture should be pretty self-apparent from the way it's defined in the article (""""social movement[s] that [promote] the freedom to distribute and modify creative works, using the Internet as well as other media""""), and from the license used. The self-referencing seems ok, as the text says that writing about wikipedia is ok where it's relevant. If wikipedia is an example of online free culture, then it's relevant. As for wikipedia not using copyrighted material without permission, I don't see that as any stranger than FLOSS not gobbling up proprietary software. Free culture things are things that let you copy, distribute and modify them. Proprietary things generally don't, and so using them without permission isn't allowed, and therefore you can't include them in free culture things and have the free culture things remain free (or even legal). If you want to use copyrighted pictures and such on wikipedia, it seems to me that is to ask the owner to change the license, or at least follow fair usage guidelines.'

Sentence: 'So you find that a right-wing and left wing unreliable source agree and assume they must both be correct. There has been considerable study of Marx and there is no reason that we need to use popular books as sources. The only reason one would use them is that they contain claims that have not been accepted by mainstream historians. Also, they lead us into discussions about what really happened which is a misuse of other editors' time. We have an unsubstantiated claim by Jenny Marx made years after the event that her husband provided money for workers to buy weapons. We do not by the way have any reliable sources that these workers obtained or used weapons in Belgium in 1848. Reliable sources state that the French government supplied unemployed Belgian workers with weapons in Paris and these workers then returned to Belgium in an attempt to overthrow the government. We know that Marx was arrested on suspicion of carrying arms and was ejected from the country, but in fact the accusation was false. The types of additional sources that Martintg has provided are unreliable. Boris Nicolaevsky for example was a communist activist (writing in 1933), not a mainstream historian. Wheen and Muravchick are neoconservatives writing outside the academic mainstream. We just do not know what Marx did with the 6,000 francs he received.'

Sentence: 'Century formats Re: Alcohol laws of New Jersey. If you have a problem with centuries being spelled out (nineteenth and twentieth instead of 19th and 20th) you probably shouldn't have pointed to a policy (WP:CENTURY) that allows either form (in this case spelling it out) only requiring that usage be consistent. Claiming that the official title of a legislative act (TEA-21) that uses 21st (one mention that is not our writings and is something out of our control), is grounds for reverting 6 others in an article that is already """"internally consistent"""" as you put it, that is disingenuous and some would consider it disruptive editing. If you have any further comments, raise it on the talk page. This is not a matter of ownership, it's just that these petty format issues (whether it be dates, centuries spelled or numbered, etc.) are aggravating and unnecessary, and it's audacity to insist upon it when your claims for it are baseless.

Sentence: 'I never proposed whitewash (i.e., Peluchon's draft).

Only good sourced balanced data should appear. I think the rest of your question should probably be referred to my talk also. As near as I can tell, all talk onwiki about five figures is rumormongering and fails V (insofar as it applies to project space). (It just occurred to me, maybe Mr Laurent doesn't have the money but he can certainly string out a cheap publicity stunt without it. Anyway there are many explanations and no hard facts.)

(honest question) . Conversely, the majority of say islamic terrorists explicitly claim religious reasons for their actions (although other politico-economic issues may be as important if not more important than their ostensible reasoning). (Or one could say that there is a bias in the reporting/research causing this imbalance, but the result is the same as far as wikipedia is concerned) This certainly does not mean one group is better or worse than the other - but just that reliable sourcing on the specific topic of CT is not nearly as available as other religious terror movements.'

Sentence: 'Another thought - is describing the word as a """"neologism"""" superfluous, perhaps? I've always been an advocate of approaching writing a Wikipedia article as if everything you're writing about happened a thousand years ago and is ancient history, because it seems to me that's the proper style for an encyclopaedia, which is intended to be timeless and authoritative. """"Neologism"""" is an inescapably relative word - *all* words are neologisms looked at from one perspective in time, soon after they are invented. (All the words Shakespeare invented would be neologisms if you lived in 1630, for instance). I sincerely hope this page will be around in some form in another hundred years, at which point homophobia will no longer be a neologism. I think it's probably sufficient simply to say when and by whom the term was coined. Comments? AW'

It is patronising in the extreme to assume that using the etymologically correct plural will cause such difficulties particularly as all readers need do if they are confused is open the ecumenopoleis article in a new tab / window to be told what it means in the first sentence.

Due to people like you and your dirty politics, Nepali communities have many problems. If you really admire Bhotes then why don't you go back to Bhot and help them. Why are you trying to divide Yolmo People. Again Yolmos are not related to Tibetans, only some are. Yolmo are ethnically Nepalis(Gurkhas). Your grandfather might have have come to Nepal to from Bhot, but it doesn't mean you are a true Nepali. Yolmo people have problems because guys like you bring different bhote things in the name of dharma. I think you are a disciple of Shyama Rinpoche. how much money you receive from him to divide Yolmos? Nowadays people like you have fully integrated into Nepal by purchasing lots of property in Nepal, this doesn't mean you are a Nepali. At last you are always a Goo Bhote. So goo bhote bo back to Bhot and worship Shyama rinpoche, drink lots of Bhote tea, tea chauri but please, i beg you don't divide yolmo people of Nepal. and yolmos are nepali and have nothing to do with Bhot.

Sentence: '::Addendum: I think I may have found the source of the confusion. Within the medical establishment, a medical student who has not yet received his or her MD is referred to as an """"undergraduate"""", in contrast with residents who've received their MDs but are not yet board-certified. In that context, a medical student is an """"undergraduate"""" because he or she has not graduated from the MD program. However, that does not mean that an MD is an """"undergraduate degree"""" as that term is usually understood in the US. That term is reserved for bachelor degrees; any program (such as medical school or law school) which is generally attained after four-year college is called a """"graduate program"""", and the degrees it grants are """"graduate degrees"""". I think that the current wording is adequate to avoid this confusion. It's worth noting that in practice, it's extremely rare to find a medical student in the US who doesn't already have a degree from a four-year college. My wife's a medical student, and every one of her classmates has a BS or BA. (talk contribs)'

Sentence: '==Material deleted, incorrect material put in place by user Pgagnon999== A certain user has deleted correct information and posted politically biased information in this article. These are all in the first three paragraphs on the history of the town. Paragraph 1. The original town name of Middletown was spelled """"Mattabeseck"""", this can be seen in the records of the general Assembly of Connecticut, which were QUOTED in this article until the ignorant and unscrupulous poster deleted the reference. This is significant in that southwestern Algonquin was spoken with a much harder inflection on the consonants, -and Mattabeseck is a southwestern Algonquin town. Paragraph 2. Quotations about Puritan life in general are irrelevant in this article. Paragraph 3. William Cronin is not a reliable source for local detail in Connecticut. Cronin's highly inflammatory accounts of the history of the settlement of America is very controversial, and has been shown to be very factually inaccurate and unreliable. It was very popular as a piece of political argument, and very poor historical scholarship. That this article MUST include this kind of erroneous detail is unfortunate. That the systems and procedures that define Wikipedia are not able to withstand this kind of assault from the politically-minded and ignorant marks the limitation of Wikipedia's usefulness.'

I propose we adopt the following: Evolution: Umbrella term, any change over time, as stated in first sentence of article. Natural selection, horizontal gene transfer, etc... Mechanisms which explain evolution, the observation. Theories of evolution: A theory to explain one particular facet of evolution in terms of natural history (e.g. Out of Africa Theory, CretaceousPaleogene extinction event) The other problem with this article is that many scientists were motivated by a desire to explain why livings things are adapted to their environment or to explain the diversity of life.

Perhaps racist scientists should be. But even here I would qualify it not only do I not want to put some racist scientists in the US or Canada in the same category of Joseph Mengele, I think the crucial difference is precisely the social context we live in a society based on free debate where a few scientists can be racist and they will be challenged publically and a well-informed public can make up its mind. In the 1930s racist scientists lived in racist societies, both here and in Germany, and their work was used to justify and promote horrible things. But today such scientists in eitehr the US or Germany can say what they want and for the most part, thanks in part to open scientific debate, and democratic societies where there is vigorous public debate in legislatures, their work has not had the same awful effect.

I'll be looking in the full copyvio version to see if there is anything else and port it back into the article when I have a moment. As I expect will confirm, close paraphrasing is where copyright laws become really tough to comply with, and I sympathize with the difficulty this presents. Nonetheless, I cannot, for obvious reasons, restore the text of the career section, as any modification of that would constitute an unauthorized derivative.

Sentence: 'I understand quite well how evolution is supposed to work. I understand the capriciousness and contingencies in the workings of evolution. It is the paragraph in question, especially the example in that paragraph, which distorts the workings of evolution. The phrase it need only increase at a rate of 0.005 cm per generation (= 50 cm/10,000) easily gives the impression of progressive linear change. The anthropocentric notions of directionality and purpose often (I assume inadvertently) find their way into the writings of specialists who attempt to explain various forms of Darwinian evolution. From these I have often read how evolution invents various forms and functions. Carl Sagan, in my opinion one of the worst offenders in these matters, injected anthropocentric notions on a massive scale so as to justify his idea of a million highly advanced technological civilizations in the Galaxy. I read your paragraph as suffering from the same notions of directionality.'

Sentence: 'Speedy deletion of Philvidler666 A tag has been placed on Philvidler666 requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. fisto'

Sentence: 'I've noticed that as well. That's actually what confuses me the most: If it really is a single, why can't I buy it anywhere? Honestly, I think that if people write it as a """"single"""", they don't really care if it isn't available separately; simply calling something a single doesn't specify whether it's promo or not. For people trying to cater to consumers, like Billboard.com reviews, if it's a popular hit and/or music video, people know it; it doesn't matter under what technical details it was released. But I think the difference is that since we are able to specify this, we probably should. We should try to reflect the reality. I don't think having a music video and a high placement in charts does anything to change the type of single it is; I've seen music videos for promo singles many times before; even some for album tracks. Isn't it a promo single nevertheless if it's only available separate from the album for promotional purposes? It's not like this is degrading the single in any way either; some artists just don't release subsequent album singles separately for consumers because they'd rather prefer they buy the album.'

Sentence: '::::::I'm not sure if """"See also"""" sections are supposed to have descriptions for the links they provide, but in this case I think little descriptions won't hurt. I.e. non-believers, for one, will find a link to Luther's Small Catechism odd, especially since that article doesn't mention Bach. Would you be so kind to add a few small clarifications? I.e. something like """"Luther's Small Catechism, the Catechism Bach taught to students at the Thomasschule"""" (assuming it was Thomasschule, as I have no idea) instead of a simple link. Also, Christian symbolism in Bach's works is certainly an interesting topic, and it is already mentioned in the """"Style"""" section. Perhaps one day someone will feel bold enough to create something like Musical style of Johann Sebastian Bach, and then we'd have enough space to elaborate on this aspect of Bach's work. For now, though, the article is already way too large (and has to grow larger, as there are few inline citations, the References section is underdeveloped, etc.).'

Sentence: '::Nice wording there. That's the point. It's a fact. It's not a """"portrayal"""" that is """"too positive"""". It's a fucking FACT. What planet is this?

And they state it explicitly: """"Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all-time"""", """"By acclamation Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all-time"""". How much more explicit do you expect it to get? They aren't going to waltz the answer out to you. This is an objective look at someone who demonstrably showed that they were the greatest. If editing is a problem, then just create a special lock or something for the opening paragraph that only the top moderators can unlock. Every source in existence acknowledges him as #1 all-time.

Sentence: 'Outback / Drinking Urine == Once again, Bear teaches people how to get themselves killed. As Wikipedia's own article on dehydration and the article on human urine notes, drinking urine, like drinking saltwater, does nothing at best, and increases the rate of dehydration at worst. Normal urine contains about 95% water and 5% dissolved solids, much of which is salts. The more dehydrated you are, the higher the percentage of salt in the urine. Your body is only about 1% salt. Water follows a diffusion gradient, so water *leaves* your cells to dilute the urine. The kidneys can pump ions out of your blood to try and lower the salt concentration, but not *that* effectively. Just like drinking seawater to survive is stupid and nearly universally recommended against, you shouldn't survive on urine, either. And here, we're just talking about the salt, let alone the ammonia, nitrates, aldehydes, and other toxins that your body is trying to get rid of. And all of this assumes that it doesn't make you vomit outright and lose even more water. To viewers of the show: don't do it! Of course, we're not allowed to mention anything except for the press release blurbs on the article itself. P =='

I think keeping info about the leagues is fine, I have no problem with that at this point. The junior team articles I have seen so far just say the team name and the city, even though it is already stated in the league article. And they will not get any bigger or better unless a lot of unnotable cruft is placed in, which is the last thing that WP needs. And as for the wikiproject, you don't have to obey to the original standards. A wikiproject is designed to give a community for editors to collaborate on a subject, it's not meant to be official policy.

Sentence: 'It is true that """"Lots of more modern arts hang without frames."""" But the Signac paintings are 100 years old. And even contemporary art in a Wikipedia article benefits from frames in their presentation to the viewer. Virtually any image benefits from lines echoing the delineation of the (usually rectangular) image. This is somewhat similar to the way scare quotes call attention to a word or phrase. The scare quotes are setting off that word or phrase for special consideration. We have a vested interest in trying to get the reader to take special notice of each image of artwork that we include in an article. If we are going to argue that Wikipedia is not an art gallery or that these thumbnails are hardly impressive in their dimensions and scarceness of detail, then why bother including images of famous paintings at all? I think we all agree that the images are all educational in an art historical kind of way. Therefore it seems like a poor move to reduce their usefulness to the reader by removing the framing lines and the emphasis those lines impart to the image.'

Apparently she wants no one to know that Ryulong deleted my request for help on Khoikhoi's talk page, falsely describing my request for help as """"vandalism"""" in his edit summary. Oops! Was it """"uncivil"""" again, for me to tell the truth? If so, then prosecutors in court will never be able to tell the truth about crimes, because it would be an """"uncivil"""" """"personal attack"""" to use words such as """"lie"""", """"dishonest"""", """"vandal"""", """"thief"""", """"murderer"""", """"rapist"""", etc. The judge would get too upset by such """"uncivil comments"""". Come to think of it, every time an admin describes a user's action as """"vandalism"""", or a user as a """"vandal"""", that's an improper """"personal attack"""", according to pschemp's logic.

The images you uploaded are probably copyrighted. If the website you found them on does not explicitly say that the images are released under a free license or into the public domain, you have to consider them copyrighted and unavailable for use. You could consider emailing the photographer and asking them to release it under the GFDL, though. Take a look at this page Wikipedia:Image use policy, this page Wikipedia:Image copyright tags, and this page Wikipedia:Copyrights.

Sentence: '==Number of Adepts == Because Spiritist Moviment doesn't proselytizes and is not a religious denomination (as states in the article), there is no current estimation for the number of Spiritists in Brazil. The IBGE estimation came from the census on religion, but many Spiritists do not consider themselves Spiritism """"followers"""", because it is not a religion. Another poll made by a established poll research institution in Brazil shows that half of Brazilian population believes in reincarnation. Once Buddhism and Hinduism are almost non-existent in Brazil, it shows the strong influence of The Spiritist Doctrine and other native believes in Brazil. Moreover, in another poll (Rede Globo Mineira, 2000) in the populous State of Minas Gerais, Chico Xavier, the most popular spiritist medium in Brazil, was elected the Mineiro (Minas's citizen) of the century, competing against other popular celebrities like the former President Juscelino Kubischeck and inventor Santos Dumont. Recently Epoca Magazine comments an statistic of 20 to 30 millions of spiritists in Brazil. For the reasons above I'm removing the badly grounded statistics about the number of spiritists in Brazil.'

Sentence: 'I saw the latter, of course. It wasn't directly aimed at you, but I didn't like it, either. Um.. you know what a diff is, do you? Just in case: You can get one by looking at the history of any page, selecting two versions, and then pressing the """"Compare selected versions"""" button. You can include it by putting the complete link (with http:// etc) into single brackets like this: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/example_diff], the result will then appear like this, or like this. Look at the markup, you'll figure out the rest. These diffs or differences are often used as proof of precisely which edit by another user you are talking about. That's one beautiful thing about a wiki: It doesn't forget anything, which means that people have to think before they press """"Save page"""". Alright, enough explained. Again, can you provide any diffs? Regarding truth, you may want to take a look at WP:A (especially this section, by the way). You see, Wikipedia has a set of guidelines and policies. Attribution, not truth, is the aim. I certainly appreciate that you care about Wikipedia like most of us do, but it's all about working together, not against each other.

Sentence: 'Terminology They are substantives derived from the French verb """"tracer"""", which normally means """"trace"""",[9] or """"trail"""" (as in """"he escaped without a trace"""").[10] The """"trail"""" bit, along with its explanation, doesn't seem to make much sense to me. The verb """"tracer"""" is commonly used in French slang to denote fast movement. In the lexicon used in footnote [9], the most accurate definition would be II A 3: """"Marcher vite"""", (""""walking fast"""")and """"filer"""" (""""to go fast""""). This is consistent with most of the synonyms of """"tracer"""" that denote movement, such as """"aller trs vite"""" or """"courir"""" . It ties in with the fact that parkour is described as """"moving around obstacles with speed and efficiency"""".

Sentence: 'Comment on Implementations There is 3rd common way of implementing deques and that is as an array of pointers to fixed sized pages of the elements (usually a power of 2, even 1 element) The advantage of this scheme is that if new elements are inserted at the front or end of the deque, pages containing elements in the middle of the deque need not be disturbed. Nearly all the C++ vendor implement in this fashion. Note also: The C++ deque cannot be implemented using an array. There is a requirement that references to elements in the middle of a deque remain valid if only the only thing done to the deque is add new elements at either end. An array implementation would fail when the array needs to be reallocated.'

If you realize it was part of a larger issue, why not simply either decline to comment, or leave remarks on the RfC noting you have also observed his inappropriate behavior (as you noted on his own talk page as well). Your message, instead, did nothing to help his case either. As for """"loony"""" warning messages, there was nothing loony about it. You seemed to be asking for a civility warning for calling me a Nazi, so I just gave you what you asked for. None of this has any affect on Abtract's case at all.

Sentence: 'Taking Chopa as an example, in the Discography section the album information for each of their 3 albums is pretty much the same thing that can be found on each individual album's page. The albums are already linked to. So what I am suggesting is removing what is duplicative and migrating anything that does not appear for each individual album onto that respective album's article page. In the end, you would be left with a Discography section listing all 3 albums. I also noticed the Notes on selected pieces section; this section be taken out of the Chopa article and appear in the pages for all 3 albums containing only those notes relevant for that particular album. As it appears right now, the reader cannot tell where a song appears unless he/she scrolls up and searches. It would be more relevant to have the specific information pertaining to songs appearing on particular albums on the respective album's pages.'

Not only is [the book] true, but there's more. And it was worse. Later on under the sub heading Reaction, it says: Apparently it all came flooding back to him, he was reliving the whole trip! He was yelling out and jumping on his seat like it was a rollercoaster, ducking and diving, shouting 'SHIT! LOOK OUT! GODDAM BATS!' That was fantastic if he thought we'd captured it, then we must have done it.

The issue of slavery being based on assumed inferiority is obviously core to the controversy, but there is also a lot of waffle including arbitrary observations and one guy who merely quoted Herodotus in his dictionary. This section is basically the longest in the article, and it thus gives undue weight to stuff that is not really core. I propose to thin this section down to focus on the controverial issue around slavery. Any objections? Herodotus is in the Classical section and is quoted from Du Bois. Regarding the length of that 19th section, I have no comments for the moment. Actually, I see other sections with the same length. =='

Sentence: 'Dumb question? Would the repeal of withholding, via Constitutional amendment, apply only to Fed income taxes? That is to say, would the States be bound to repeal withholding as well, since they are the ones necessarily ratifying it in the first place? I may have missed it inside the article (which is very good indeed) and if I did I apologize, but it seems to me that once the repeal of withholding becomes an established fact, a great deal of political power passes from the politicians back to the consumer. Simply put, a dollar represents a unit of freedom. And if the phrase """"a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"""" has any truth to it at all, it means political power is being leveraged, indeed heavily back to the consumer/producer for every dollar he keeps. That is an extremely compelling argument, it seems, though hardly ever mentioned. Regards. 155.188.183.6'

So Harry will have to be in this movie. What about Venom? In Spidy cartoon, one the old one, it's kinda like modern, the cartoon that sometimes have 3D buildings. In that cartoon, Spidey had the venom custome before, then abandoned it, and the venom came to Eddy Brook. I am thinking, the ending of this movie, might be Peter leaving the Venom suit, and the suit meeting up with Eddy, then Venom will appear in Spiderman 4 Sorry, if this is a spoiler:P I must be working for Sony Pictures;P 3 villians in this movie.w0w...3 hours long...like Lord of The rings:)'

Ive never denied that my record at Wiki is rich with demerits; both Custer and Reno (especially Reno) were masters of the demerit at West Point. No dishonor in that. My advice to Sensei48 is to form a skirmish line, and hold that position. Do not retreat to the timber. Neither should he order a charge to the rear: that way disaster lies. I include the rousing Notre Dame Victory March to help inspire you to defend your remarks of May 5, 2011: Rally sons of Notre Dame Sing her glory, and sound her fame Raise her Gold and Blue, And cheer with voices true, Rah! Rah! For Notre Dame. We will fight in every game Strong of heart and true to her name. We will ne'er forget her And we'll cheer her ever, Loyal to Notre Dame. Chorus: Cheer, cheer for Old Notre Dame Wake up the echoes cheering her name, Send the volley cheer on high, Shake down the thunder from the sky, What though the odds be great or small Old Notre Dame will win over all, While her loyal sons are marching Onward to Victory.

If you don't mind, I would like to ask a question so I can better understand this; I am new to this, still learning. The background is that in the 1800s, the European settlement of the Sydney area was in its early days. Place names were informal, and often duplicated. There were at least two, probably three places on Sydney Harbour known as """"Ballast Point"""" then. This is what I attempted to clarify with my comment that it was another site also known by that name. The revised wording gives me the impression that there was only one place of that name in the 1800s, and it changed. So can you please indicate why the new wording is preferred, so I can adopt the best approach in future?'

Taken in a broader context, that is how artististic political characaturists and comic impressionists make their living. Did Carter really smile broadly and instantly? Did Ronald Reagan really say """"Well"""" at the beginning of sentences? Where would we be without Dana Carvey and Rich Little? Obviously, this is an issue that both you and I feel strongly about.

I never admit it to other people in private life. Methods have to change or WP will die and become known as more of a failure than it currently is known as. Thanks for your soothing words, though. You are off-the-wall and slightly out-of-control but had a big input, I think, and I took it as your sick sense of humour and liked most of it. I wasn't here that long (gab, the stalking harassment suckybaby is screaming now) but I have seen enough to confirm what is being shouted around the Internet about the wiki garbage spewed here. Wiki:suicide is eminent (sorry I have no second sourced hearsay level gossip to reference). That coward Coren just didn't have the balls to do a proper job after the latest BS the admins have been through the latest to """"lighten up 'cause we need more editors"""". On a lighter note There are many blogs and websites describing how to remove Wikipedia from your search engine so the garbage doesn't keep appearing mixed in with the real information. It was fun not being an admin and seeing the other side, for awhile. Now I understand more about being a dumb nigger. ooops... Did I say that out loud? Fuckin' A!! (for the AmE people Fuckin' huh!)

Sentence: 'Mod Problem I see that on your user page you list pages/users blocked, articles edited, etc etc. Is this just a history of your stalking, trolling, and abusive bullshit? It seems to be that you're a loser who needs to brag that you troll Wiki and block users who try to make the site a better place. Most of your stuff is done in secret, but when somebody does expose you for being a trolling loser, you simply block them from even being able to talk on their own talk page. Guess what? A person's personal talk page is not yours for editing as it does NOT need to be factual. If it did, it would be the user's Facts page, not the Talk page. It's for Talking, which you as a troll clearly wouldn't want if that discussion revolved around you abusing your privileges as an admin. If the right people saw that they might take away those little jpg badges that you think are real and then your life would be worthless even to you, like it is to the rest of the world. It's good to know that you guys are immature, CHILDISH, irrelevant trolls with absolutely nothing resembling a real life.'

Sentence: 'I was motivated to add value to articles. Then a cadre of fascist, self-important, imperious, asinine pricks took it upon themselves to systematically target my contributions, which were well withing guidelines and certainly along the lines of the 1000's of cultural references in Simpson's articles. They reverted my contributions, deleted my hard work, gang edited my stuff, refused to compromise or in any way work for anything but their own dictatorial will. Now I'm motivated to be as asinine and ignorant as they are. I'm wholesale deleting anything without a source or reference. I'm disallowing references I personally feel are insufficient. Every article locked I feel is a victory, because it diminishes Wikipedia to lock articles, and its due to their actions that they are locked, so I feel vindicated. Leave all the messages you like, I doubt I'll get them because I use proxies and different IPs so I can do my good work without hindrance. A hearty fuck you to yourself and any other of your cocksucking brethren, faggot. Eat shit and die. Get cancer.

"Given a sentence, respond with only 'True' if the sentence is toxic or else 'False'.
Sentence: 'Yes, the graph is misleading, but many textbooks and research papers have similar Arrhenius plots which do not show the true y-axis. The reason is that k varies very rapidly with T so that it is usually only convenient to study a small range of T, here 590-660 K. The true y-axis at x = 1/T = 0 corresponds to infinite T and is very far from the experimental range, or """"way off the graph"""". If we insist on a graph which goes to x = 0, the measured points will cover only a small part of the graph which would make it hard to understand. (It would also have led to inaccurate determination of Ea in the days when slopes were determined manually with graph paper, although this is no longer true since slopes are now determined by linear regression with a spreadsheet such as Excel.) So instead of replacing the graph, I will explain in the article that the left side of the graph is not in fact the y-intercept, and that ln A corresponds to the true y-intercept which must be calculated. Putting a // on the x-axis is also a good idea which I have seen in some textbooks, if someone has the software to re-draw the graph that way.'

I think the traditional list is quite obvious: 1241, 1526, 1849, 1920, 1956. Luckily no present-day event has a similar magnitude, from some wider perspective they are only a strong storm, small riots etc. What the article really needs, I think, are literary sources mentioning the curse.

Cyphoidbomb, your last sentence is """"As a man, I want his testicles revoked."""" Didn't u learn english. You should tell """"As a transgender, I want his testicles revoked."""" I know, you want my testicles, because u wanna attach it to your body since u don't have it. Have fun doing the shittest job in the world, editing wiki. Loosers. Now cry all over again.'

Also, no need to add 'fact' i.e. everywhere.

Sentence: 'Sorry for horning into your talk page, but I'm still drafting the remount service article and hope to do one on the remount concept as well. Early on the Army decided that it was cost-prohibitive to maintain whole herds, so they used the remount stations to house selected stallions and then contracted out with local horse breeders to provide mares. Robinson was the main headquarters once the Remount Service really got organized (after World War I), but as Montanabw pointed out the majority of the actual stations were in the West. One thing the remount service is credited with (as it was only in operation on a large scale for about 20-25 years) was an overall improvement of the quality of horses in civilian service. This was because the Army didn't (and couldn't) buy all the animals produced by the program and the breeders were allowed to keep those that didn't meet standards or were otherwise unneeded.'

I haven't wathced Amercin network news programs intentionally in over 20 years, as they spend 22 minutes on expanded """"personal"""" stories, with litte har """"American"""" news coverage, much less anything else from the rest of the world! I grew up where you could turn on the radio at 3pm, and listen to an hour of BBC World Radio news coverage - now THAT was comprehensive. Don't know if they're still that way or not. Also, US government-run schools are atrocious, and spend little time on world events outside of America's di direct interaction, and currently most of that is in a purely negative light.

As far as searching goes, I don't think this will disrupt anything, but I feel that it should be the accurate title.

Sentence: 'Jews== In response to the section below, if there were no Arab Jewish tribes, there are certainly Arab Jews. Despite the fact that many Jews in the Middle East left (or were encouraged to leave) during the 1950s and 60s to non-Arabic speaking countries, many still keep their identity as both Arabs and Jews. Continued pressure within the Jewish community to act more like the Eastern European-descendant Jews only means that it is all the more important to recognize Jewish people of Arab descent (and whose first language was often Arabic, then Hebrew) on this page. It would make sense to do so, however, with the caveat that some Arabic-speaking Jews identify both as Jews and as Arabs, while some do notjust as it's done for Christians from the Arab world on this page. ==Arab'

Perhaps Users such as Blixx are good friends of yours. Given this then it is impossible for me to get treated fairly as you are apparently biased towards them. I find it astounding that you have gone to great lengths to supress my views by blocking me from editing, blocking me from contacting the head as well as yourself and for added measure you have blocked me from emailing. All because I complained about my treatment, lets face it the excuse about me edit warring is just a smokescreen, you just don't like it when I diagree with a point of view. Are you following the orders of Blixx and co? Yet you make no mention of their personal attacks and abuse on me - they have called me 'a nasty piece of work', 'an islamist', 'Haddad's puppet' etc. Have you even warned them? I think not. So its ok for them to make personal attacks on me but when I criticise Blixx and co I get punished. One rule for one and one rule for another eh?

It seems such events could trigger substantial 'non-spontaneous' decay that would cause is discontinuity in the typical half-life curve and set dates off by an order of magnitude.

Anybody with half a brain would be able to figure out what I'm trying to say: my response to rd232 is that he himself undermines the legitimacy of his actions of deleting my additions of criticisms of CounterPunch on its Wikipedia page when he points out, """"it's feasible to cover the relevant controversies in a neutral and balanced manner (written as part of the History section, and avoiding unnecessary direct quotation of political opponents' smear phrases"""" which means that not only are changes (not deletion) of the criticisms doable, but also that the quotes of criticism about CounterPunch need to exist in the first place if you want to make the quotes as balanced as possible. (which again, can't be done if Rd232 is deleting any criticism of CounterPunch in the first place) But again, like I said, chances are you probably won't understand what I'm saying because my writing abilities are above and beyond your level of reading comprehension, so it's unlikely you're response will comprise of anything more than ad hominems, rather than addressing the content of my comment.'

Sentence: 'All these points are very interesting and worthy of study and thought, but these points also remain: Jews remind themselves every year """"Slaves were we in Egypt,"""" and no real Jews would ever say: """"We are children of Abraham and we were never enslaved."""" The Synoptics contain several references to tax collectors and John not a single one. Josephus indeed does not say who was the leader of the great Jewish protest in Caesarea, and rather gives the impression that it was spontaneous and acephalous, but this is rather hard to believe. A brief mention of the Crucifixion of Jesus by Pilate follows, which may or may not be a useful hint. Besides the tax collectors, John also omits the Baptism of Jesus, the Temptation, the Transfiguration, the Kiss of Judas, the Tears of Peter, the institution of the Eucharist, etc. Roman historians are just as bad as the Gospel writers when it comes to confusing Procurators and Prefects. The archaeological evidence says that Pilate was a Prefect, but both Tacitus and the Gospels call him a Procurator, just to confuse us, perhaps. Das Baz, 18 April 2006, 10:51 AM.'

No, I tried that and it was rightly shot down. You can find a source - a famous one! - which says that this opera is a shabby little shocker. And those words aren't even listed as ones to avoid, so do we use them as if they are objectively true? Obviously not. I don't believe the word is forbidden on Wikipedia, I already said that. But we have a guideline called """"words to avoid"""". It doesn't say """"avoid these words, unless you really want to use them"""", it doesn't say """"avoid these words unless you see them in external sources"""", it says """"avoid these words, because they neither impart nor summarise verifiable information"""".

So Maven is the """"magician's magician"""" though he doesn't have the public recognition of the others, he is an industry-respected innovator and mentor, and those are the criteria that you use to define """"great"""". We should definitely work on an article about him then. If you can pile up references on his discussion page (or feel free to take a stab at writing the article itself, if you're comfortable you can stick to WP:NPOV). Now, my next question is one of terminology. What word do you use in the industry to distinguish between the publicly-known magicians such as Copperfield, Penn & Teller, Siegfried & Roy, Doug Henning, etc., to define their fame? If they're not on a list of """"great"""", what list would you put them on?'

Sentence: '::::::Agreed, although it means bloating the alternative title by yet another word. I was concentrating on the Polish attitude here, as it clearly provides the starting point for the article at hand. Obviously, if the article is to be written from a supra-national perspective, at least the Czech experience needs to be included. Czechoslovakia, being the only functioning democracy in the region by the 1930s, had closer ties with the West than Poland did, and was """"betrayed"""" in a much more obvious and tangible way than Poland was: The West politically accepted the country's territorial mutilation, which was not the case with Poland. That said, I am not sure if the inclusion of countries such as Finland, the Baltics, Yugoslavia, or even Ukraine (which had never been independent in the first place) is a good idea. While the West could have arguably done more to assist any of these societies before and after the war, I think that the article's focus should be on Poland and Czechoslovakia in order not do dilute the whole issue. After all, there were dissidents in Germany and the Soviet Union, too, who were harbouring grudges towards Western politicians because of their appeasement policy. 19:06, 17 Oct 2004 (UTC)'

Sentence: 'Dirtiness of thermonuclear bombs An unsupported statement is made that """"... the smaller a thermonuclear bomb is, the """"dirtier"""" it is ..."""" This is misleading, if not untrue. Bombs are optimised for an entirely different purpose. It is true that in small and large bombs, the bulk of the yield is from fission, but this is a design decision, and can easily be eliminated by using a non-fissile tamper material. The secondary of a small multi-stage bomb is just another boosted fission stage, fusion yield negligible. The largest bomb ever tested (~50MT) was fairly clean, but only because the fissile tamper was removed from the secondary to reduce contamination. Small ultra-clean bombs have also been tested. The article is about the current art of laser-driven ICF. Fission-driven ICF was the first mechanism used and has been proven, so a summary definitely belongs here. The details of using large explosions for power belong in another more general nuclear power article.'

Sentence: 'Criticisms of an Innately Modular Mind Many of the criticisms of EP have to do with their belief that nature selected a mind characterized by innately pre-specified domain-specific information-processing modules that were adapted to solve specific problems within our Pleistocene past. This section was intended to include criticisms of their 'massively' or even 'mostly-massively' assumptions with regard to modularity. However, the 'rebuttals' seem aimed, not toward defending their position, but toward attacking an entirely domain-general version of the mind. Firstly, this kind of structure does not address the criticisms pertaining to the EP position, and are thus not 'true' rebuttals to these criticisms. Secondly, it creates a false-dichotomy and strawman presentation of the critics, suggesting that the only other 'alternative' to the EP definition of the mind is an entirely domain-general one. My suggestion, is to either cut these kinds of rebuttals, or to add a separate section beneath it titled: """"Criticisms of the Domain-General Model of Mind."""" Let us describe EPers fighting their strawmen in a separate section.'

Sentence: 'Hi Paranoid. I aggree that the Moscow page needs work. We also need to work on articles within moscow - for example, the MSU page is shocking bad. But I'd argue that most people who add to the moscow page have an honest interest and fondness for the place, or they wouldn't bother editing it. Maybe what we need is a 'List of Moscow related articles needing work' or some such. The Recreation section is bad and It been an eyesore since feb. What should we add to it? There's a F1 circuit being built in the south, anybody want to add that? also some stuff on the football clubs would be good (we can leave out the supporter violence, which is a usual thing all over the world). To be honest, I don't know much about this area - not a football fan. I'd also argue against only adding material which is positive. We shouldn't have an audience only of americans in mind.'

The common theory is that the motif of the conspirators' secret meeting on a cemetary (which Goedsche took from Dumas and Sue), after having been published independently from the rest of Goedsche's novel, was merged with material from Joly's satire to create the infamous Protocols. Weblinks I removed the first weblink, as it leads to a personal blog which (despite its title) contains nothing about Goedsche/Retcliffe whatsoever.'

Photo redux OK, now we have yet another new photo - the one of Michelle waving on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. I like it, think it is a good photo - and until we have an official portrait I'd go with this one. But rather than repeatedly changing the picture can we discuss here from now on and try to come to consensus on any alternatives?

Sentence: 'Excellent points about some of the other very important events in history! Reportedly, Columbus kidnapped a handful of natives and brought them back to Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand of Spain. Whether or not he was abusive toward them aboard ship remains undecided. Some say he was kind to them (according to his journal!) while others say differently. At any rate, with the order of Isabella and Ferdinand, the thousands upon thousands of Spanish Conquistadors who invaded America, and Columbus, himself, did basically cause the destruction of many of the New World Mongoloids (whose ancestors had crossed the land bridge from Asia to America many centuries before). How strange is Mankind? Two centuries before Columbus, the Mongoloids were responsible for the destruction of many Europeans (especially Eastern Europeans) during the Mongol Empire. Later, it would be the Europeans causing the destruction of many of the New Word Mongoloids in America. It's like Ghengis Khan = Christopher Columbus (with a special nod to Isabella and Ferdinand).

Sentence: 'You foolishly defer to quantity rather than quality in your opening statement. It is about the quality of the sources, not how many there are, and seeing as the most verifiable sources from your point of view have already been put forward here ad nauseum, your case that there is widely accepted verifiable and neutrally based evidence of the late Senator's neo-conservative legacy is seriously flawed. The citations you highlight at the forefront of your case are agenda-based so heaven knows how superfluously irrelevant the other sources are. Your very deference to the quantity of sources in your opening gambit reflects the tenuous nature of your argument. I refer you back to my vegetarian analogy. The tide of truth is flowing against you, desist from your misinformed unreliable agenda-based pigeon-holing of the late Senator or risk being swept away to the sea of ignorance. I refuse to let the late Senator's name become besmirched and mislabelled by a case built on subjective sources. Those who propagate such skewed sources on WP, some would suggest are merely the """"agents of ignorance"""".'

Please reconsider. It will offend thousands of people. Virodhi Himsa Adhyatma is instructed as a college course also so its easy to verify. It can be verified going back thousands of years.

Sentence: 'Hello, I am sorry if I bullied you in any way. Those comments were not meant to harass but as of late, people have been deleting Sean Harris' page with things like """"FBFJBFJfjdbbfa"""" and the hidden message was meant to thwart those people. I accidentally saved a copy of the page with that same hidden message, so when I reverted the page I accidentally left those hidden messages along with it. I saw Beware the Night and realized that the date has been pushed back to 2014, I was acting frivolously and I apologize. Before I began editing Sean Harris' page, it consisted of nothing more than a few paragraphs of information, and I took the liberty of giving him a table featuring his film and TV work. I never meant to be a bully, but those hidden messages were out of line, and were not directed to the edits concerning his early short films. I reverted them because I didn't find them on IMDB, but now I realize I am in the wrong and I apologize dearly. I would very much like to start anew, and I thank-you for your edits and help on Sean Harris' page. He's a great actor, after all.'

The Nazis and Chinese didn't go international and seek the presence of foreign signatories, no they simply supressed (i.e, executed, tortured, imprisoned, etc..) those who violated x rule. They defined propaganda in it's most obvious form, but to compare to Israel...weird. I'm not denying this isn't propaganda, but mentioning it without overwhelming RS support and affirmation from non-oped is crucial. We might as well tag PCHR, AJ, and practically all Human Rights groups in the article - all of which have been accused of propaganda tactics during this war.

There are many other better words. The 10,000 figure isn't even mentioned in the article itself. So, if it's not important or noteworthy enough to put there, why does it belong in a broad article about the country? The 10,000 figure appears to come from his recollection. Since when do we rely one person, an activist at that, to be the sole source for a casualty estimate? The U.S.'s involvement is more of a side note here, and does not really fit in with the rest of the description of Angola's history.

You then delete my post here, which I bring back now, and attack me. You're the guilty one here. I'll show you a source - compare the two or three versions that you have. They are very different.

Sentence: 'Hi Paul. If you look at this page's history you'll see a guy called Blofeld recently made a couple of very bizarre edits. The guy then decided he was an expert on what is probably the most obscure sultanate ever to have existed. This is obviously puzzling since the sultanate is in fact the area around my girlfriend's back garden. But this is silly. You should know already that there's a rather pitiful clique on this website. They prop each other up in spats on various talk pages; they support each other's articles in the FAC process (effectively devaluing the process as a result); and seem to enjoy stalking and baiting other users. To be frank, I think it's best to treat these little boys with the contempt they deserve. Eventually they'll get bored and start creeping round someone else. Ever heard of the forest Ton Sak Yai in Uttaradit? A few days ago I uploaded an article about Buaco Forest in Portugal. Next I intend to write a piece about Ton Sak Yai.

Sentence: 'Final Fantasy (video game) I was wondering about two things regarding the article: As the article is essentially about the original game, it's pretty much assumed that the gameplay and plot sections refers to the NES version's gameplay. Therefore I believe """"(NES version)"""" in the caption of the first two images in the body are unnecessary, while the image of the WSC version needs to state that it's from the WSC version. There are several parentheses throughout the plot section that confuse me. Example: """"Lefeinish (Lufenian)"""". I think it refers to the original name, and to the name used in later versions in parenthesis, but I'm not sure. Anyway, if I'm correct, I think the parentheses can be removed, based on my first comment. A hidden note could also be added, telling the reader that the name's refer to the original game.

Sentence: 'The title refers to remarks Hickey had repeatedly made on prior visits to Harry's bar about his wife having a fling with the ice man while he was on the road. This is mentioned several times in the play. I have wondered if any double entendre with the word """"come"""" was intended which would certainly not be surprising among the characters of this play, although nothing of that kind is even hinted at in the dialog and if so that, even as just a title, it passed without comment in 1946. (Then again in 1938 the Cole Porter song My Heart Belongs to Daddy seems to make a subtle reference to cunnilingus (.. to dine on my fine finnan haddie .. asking for more .. etc) without any adverse results.) There is harsh irony in this since it appears that the opposite is the case, that Hickey's wife was totally faithful and endlessly forgiving of his womanizing and drinking sprees. This surfeit of virtue creates such self-hatred in Hickey and anger at his wife that he is ultimately driven to kill her to end their common pipe dream that each of his indiscretions will be the last.'

Sentence: 'Brews, the rotating identical spheres makes a good action-reaction pair example. We'll begin with the general radial equation as it applies to sphere A, Applied centripetal force + induced centrifugal force = m were r is the radius. Since the string joining the spheres is not changing in length, then m will be equal to zero and so the centrifugal force outwards on sphere A will be equal to the centripetal force inwards on sphere A, which is given by tension T. Hence T = mv^2/r which equals both the centrifugal force and the centripetal force. Every force acting on sphere A will have an equal and opposite force acting on sphere B. Hence the centripetal force (-T) acting on sphere B could be considered as a reactive centrifugal force from the perspective of sphere A. This example is OK, but because it is circular, it masks the general picture. If you were to choose an elliptical example, that would eliminate some of the equalities and also eliminate any confusion that might ensue from those equalities. That's why I favour a more complicated example such as a Keplerian orbit.'

Sentence: 'DeCausa, your pissing me off. First of all I have provided many different sources, I didn't just use Kurdistanica. Anytime I used a source, you basically said that It was unacceptable, which is false. You just wanted to deny it because you felt like it. How do I know? Because you did the same with the sources on the Kurdish language. Almost all sources regard Kurdish language as one but you decided to use 4 source, (3 that are actually relevant) that say otherwise. What does that tell you? Do you think I was born yesterday? Oh and by the way, I wasn't talking about my proposal. I was taking about the propsal above mine. Right now there are more people that are supporting the lift of the term """"Iranian"""" on Kurds, but I see no changes. With my propsal, however, you did not let anybody to look at it. As soon as I posted it up, you decided to be a douchebag and just write all nonsense below it, before anyone could even say yes I agree or disagree. I suggest you don't talk to me again.

They got CONQUERED BY WHITE SPANIARDS aka TRUE HISPANICS and that is the reason non-White, RED Mexicans are HISPANOPHONES, they're not Hispanics (FROM SPAIN IS THE TRUE DEFINITION OF HISPANIC!!), they are Mayans or Aztecs or whatever tribe. The native people of Spain, are White! Maybe, since retarded yanks can't grasp these FACTS, them Mexicans ought to be shamed for their defeated, loser past so they can quit speaking the EUROPEAN SPANISH language and go back to speaking Aztec, that way you imbeciles will quit calling these NON-SPANIARDS, NON-WHITES """"Hispanics"""" or """"Latino"""" and call them what they are, Red indigenous native Americans.

The original wikilink (probably an unintentional typo) pointed to the town of Lymington, England, so I de-wikified it. The Lymington Foundation is a bird conservation organization in State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. It's also the name of a much larger charity, which is not associated with the conservation organization. The Lymington Foundation is associated with Spix Macaw, a flagship nearly extinct bird. They have international connections to Al Wabra Wildlife Preservation, Loro Parque, Association for the Conservation of Threatened Parrots, and World Parrot Trust Their website is apparently http://www.pipress.org/2009/11/the-lymington-foundation/. There's not a lot of press about it - it's a family foundation. Maybe it's too local an organization? I'm going to stop here until I get some feed back. I've placed the name in the Lymington disambiguation section, where it has a dead(red) link. In that way, its similar to the names of many obscure biological species without separate articles.

Sentence: 'Dear GoW, you seem to have missed something obvious in your little comment - neither time that Giano finished with an old account was he blocked. That does not inspire confidence in your detective skills. Giano has, in the past, attempted to remove himself from the project by scrambling his password; and then decided to return. For Giano, it was considered more appropriate to do it under a new username rather than request a new password (Giano is not the most computer savvy of editors - he rather concentrates on the content than the means of placing it upon the page). Furthermore, very likely the vast majority of established editors are fully aware of who Giano is - and his previous accounts. WP:Alternate accounts does allow people to have different accounts, and even allows them to be used at the same time (but not in the same places, usually) - it is the undisclosed use of multiple accounts, designed to circumvent Wikipedia policy, that is not permitted. I suggest that, when you start digging for information, you make yourself familiar with all aspects of a matter, otherwise you may find that the result of your excavating is that you are simply in a deep and dark hole.

It is clear that the person had psychiatric problems as a result of this episode, and that any reasonable person might deduce that such problems might be perpetuated and compounded by the digged determination to print the victim's name. Your 'genie in the bottle' analogy again ignores the points that have been made to you above; just because another publication prints his name doesn't mean WP has to, particularly as WP is more likely to be first port of call for anyone searching for information on the video. As for your hope that the article serves as a cautionary tale - how is the inclusion of his name going to further that 'hope'? Finally, you doidn't answer the question I posed, which in my opinion is the nub: 'perhaps you might put yourself in his shoes for one moment, and then ask yourself whether your determination to include what most agree is a non-essential detail has the potential to cause yet more hurt and upset to the victim here?'

I used the capitals used in the main List of Friends episodes page where prior editor(s) capitalized all the first letters of the titles. I totally agree with your point though. I will take some time to format these correctly as well. As for the debate about having an article for each episode, I have looked for episode summaries for Friends before and they are not very in depth. What I was hoping to achieve in the wiki medium was to create relationships between plots and characters that may not be obvious in a regular 'summary' format. As another example, considering the legacy of Star Trek (and the obvious abundance of info on the series on the 'net), I think the Wiki entries for episode guides did an exceptional and unique job. (I'm even using the little nav table) I am going to try very hard not to just regurgitate what's already available out there.'

Sentence: 'October 2011 (UTC) Hi Tom, I understand and you don't have to convince me of the similarities, it's just that WP requires citations to reliable sources, in this case where the author of a book or a music paper article or a professional website like AllMusic has made the connection. So those examples above, though worthwhile in themselves, don't solve the 'citation needed' issue. However I'm sure I've seen the """"Mona"""" / """"How Soon Is Now"""" connection made in at least one book on The Smiths so let me scout around and see if I can find it. Take care and tks for stopping by to discuss. Cheers, 03:20, 20'

Sentence: 'RealDealBillMcNeill is a fool. According to everyone here, we are not fond of the way you handle the 2002present page. Do you even watch the product? Many times including the WWE 2K14 video game distinguishes the respective eras. Those being Ruthless Aggression, Universe Era and literally last week as Triple H stated, Reality Era. My contributions are accurate and it's insulting how you have """"Brand Extension"""" as if that was the only history for 10 years. I categorized by eras and even added important information you left out, because you think you know better. You are an idiot and need to stop acting like you own this page. Now you've gone and snitched so I can't rightfully edit this page. You are a coward and an idiot.'
